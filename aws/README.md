Below is a guide to help setup a AWS Elastic Kubernetes Cluster (EKS) cluster using the AWS eksclt cli utility. This guide is meant to provide steps to setup the EKS cluster. Please refer to the [helm chart](/README.md) to install openstudio-server chart once the EKS cluster is up and running.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with EKS privileges
- AWS [eksctl client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl) (v1.40.0 or higher)

## Install eksctl client

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html#installing-eksctl (v1.40.0 or higher)

## Create a cluster using eksctl

eksctl will need access to AWS. You can provide access by setting ENV variables in your shell before running the cli (example below). More advanced info on eksctl can be found here: https://eksctl.io/

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="YOUR_AWS_DEFAULT_REGION"
```

Below is an example that will create an AWS EKS cluster that has 2 node groups, one for web related pods and the other for worker pods. The web node group consists of 2 nodes of instance type `m7i.xlarge`. The worker node group consists of 1 node of instance type `c7i.xlarge` with max nodes = 6. This cluster is set to autoscale up to this max node amount. You can change the instance type and min and max node setting to your use case. More info on [AWS instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

```bash
eksctl create cluster -f eks_config_small.yaml
```

This is an example of the output you should see when you create the cluster:

```bash

Below is an example that will create an AWS EKS cluster for large workloads. It still has 2 node groups, one for web related pods and the other for worker pods, but the instance types and the maximum number of nodes are larger. The web node group consists of 1 node of instance type `m7i.8xlarge` with max nodes = 2. The worker node group consists of 1 node of instance type `c7i.24xlarge` with max nodes = 50. This cluster is set to autoscale up to this max node amount. You can change the instance type and min and max node setting to your use case. More info on [AWS instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). Note that you will need to request an increase to your on demand instance type quota at the account level. Go to [EC2 Quota Dashboard](console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/ec2/quotas) and search for "on-demand standard". Then click on "Running On-Demand Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) instances". Finally click on "Request increase at account level", enter 4000 for "Increase quota value", and click "Request".

```bash
eksctl create cluster -f eks_config_large.yaml
```
Below is an example that will create an AWS EKS cluster for large workloads where the worker pods use spot instances. It still has 2 node groups, one for web related pods and the other for worker pods, but the instance types and the maximum number of nodes are larger. The web node group consists of 1 node of instance type `m7i.8xlarge` with max nodes = 2. The worker node group consists of 1 node of instances from a list of instance types (see list below) with max nodes = 50. This cluster is set to autoscale up to this max node amount. You can change the instance type and min and max node setting to your use case. More info on [AWS instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). Note that you will need to request an increase to your spot instance type quota at the account level. Go to [EC2 Quota Dashboard](console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/ec2/quotas) and search for "standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) Spot". Then click on "All Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) Spot Instance Requests". Finally click on "Request increase at account level", enter 4000 for "Increase quota value", and click "Request". Note that this eks config includes setting the availability zone for each of the managed node groups. The key thing to consider is that they should each be in separate availability zones.

```bash
eksctl create cluster -f eks_config_large-spot.yaml
```

## EKS Add-On services

As of Kubernetes version 1.23, to use EBS volumes you must install an EKS Add-On service called EBS CSI driver. However, this step is now handled with the eksctl cluster config files. For example, in the `eks_config_small.yaml` file, these [lines of code](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-server-helm/blob/large_projects/eks_config_small.yaml#L18-L30) handles most of the EKS Add-On Services that are required.

## Connecting to your cluster using kubectl

Once eksctl is done setting up the cluster, it will automatically setup the connection by creating a `~/.kube/config` file so you and can begin using helm and kubectl cli tools to communicate to the cluster. occasionally, you need to run generate this config manually. If you are not able to run `kubectl get nodes` you can re-run the kube config setup by running `aws eks update-kubeconfig --name openstudio-server` Change the `--name` to match the cluster name if different from the example. Now that the cluster is ready, you can now deploy the helm chart. Please refer the main README.md doc for deploying the helm chart. 

## Delete the cluster using eksctl

To delete the cluster you just need to specify the name of the cluster.

`eksctl delete cluster --name openstudio-server`

This is an example of the output you should see when you delete the cluster:

```bash
[ℹ]  eksctl version 0.18.0
[ℹ]  using region us-west-2
[ℹ]  deleting EKS cluster "openstudio-server"
[ℹ]  deleted 0 Fargate profile(s)
[✔]  kubeconfig has been updated
[ℹ]  cleaning up LoadBalancer services
[ℹ]  2 sequential tasks: { delete nodegroup "standard-workers", delete cluster control plane "openstudio-server" [async] }
[ℹ]  will delete stack "eksctl-openstudio-server-nodegroup-standard-workers"
[ℹ]  waiting for stack "eksctl-openstudio-server-nodegroup-standard-workers" to get deleted
[ℹ]  will delete stack "eksctl-openstudio-server-cluster"
[✔]  all cluster resources were deleted
```

It's always good idea to verify the cluster has been deleted.

`eksctl get cluster`

This cmd should return no clusters. You can also use the web console in your AWS account to verify as well.

If the cluster didn't get fully deleted, go to [CloudFormation](console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) and manually delete the cluster stack.
